              <p>Deep generative models have recently been very popular for reconstructing
              and generating data, such as images. One of the most successful models is the
              Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE). In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07120">Tomczak and Welling (2017)</a>,
              a new Variational Mixture of Posteriors Prior (VampPrior) was introduced. It was shown to make the prior (usually
              chosen as a standard Gaussian) more flexible, allowing it to capture the latent representation to a greater extent.
              The statistical foundation lies in estimating the prior from the data instead of fixing it before the data acquisition. </p>

              <p>In this project, we have implemented the VAE with three different priors – standard Gaussian,
              VampPrior and VampPriordata – on the following datasets: staticMNIST, Caltech 101 Silhouette,
              and FreyFaces from the original paper, and FashionMNIST dataset, to extend the investigation.
              In all cases, we reproduce one of the most striking effects of using VampPrior; it
              always outperforms the standard Gaussian prior. The image above shows a comparison between reconstructed and
              artificially generated data for all datasets. <i>Parameters used: epochs = 1000, dimension of latent space = 40, batch size = 100,
              number of pseudo inputs = 500.</i></p>

              <p>In molecular dynamics simulations one has to choose between different thermostats
                to achieve a fluctuating instantaneous temperature around a constant reference temperature.
                Two such are the Berendsen thermostat (BT) and the Nosé-Hoover thermostat (NHT), which both
                preserve the expected Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution for the speed of the particles (left image shows the NHT-case). In this project,
                I show that a low $\tau$-value in BT
                and a high $\omega$-value in NHT (middle image) increase the thermostats' performance in terms of faster
                responses and lower fluctuations. During changes in reference temperature, however, a
                too high $\omega$ leads to oscillations, so in this respect, the BT is more successful.
                On the contrary, the BT fails to accurately generate energy fluctuations corresponding
                to the thermodynamics of a canonical ensemble while the NHT succeeds; it is shown that
                NHT generates a heat capacity per particle of $C_V = 2.67k_B$ at $T=85$K, which compares
                very well (right image) to the experimental value of $C_{V,\text{exp}} = 2.78k_B$.
                To switch between the thermostats, using mainly NHT but BT during changes in $T_{\text{ref}}$,
                would therefore enhance the overall performance. </p>

                <p>In this project, I remotely operated the 30 inch telescope (left) at McDonald’s Observatory in Fort Davis, Texas,
                  equipped with the SDSS (Sloan Digital Sky Survey) filters ugri, plus a narrow-band filter centered on the H-alpha
                  spectral line (Balmer series, $n=3\mapsto2$ transition). One galaxy studied was M51, of which I present
                  my own RGB-image of it above (middle). The goal of the project was to identify star-forming
                  regions (the blue circles in the right image) as those which have knots of excess H-alpha emission, since
                  this is radiation coming from the re-combination of hydrogen, a process which is especially evident when
                  stars are forming. After flux-calibrating the galaxy image using field stars,
                  I used aperture photometry to measure the fluxes of these H-alpha knots, converting to
                  the H-alpha luminosity using the known distances to these well studied galaxies. For M51,
                  I found a luminosity around $10^{39}$ erg/s in the HII-regions, which is sufficiently high to
                  indicate star formation. </p>

                  <p>Every once in a while, one of the 3620 known comets passes closely by our planet.
                    Most of their orbits are known, but unpredictable perturbations require us to constantly
                    keep track and update our orbit models. The proper motion of the comet 88P/Howell (encircled in red) was here
                    measured on May 8 2020, using the SDSS g-filter of the $30''$ telescope at McDonald's Observatory,
                    to be $32.41 \pm 5.16$ arcseconds per hour (right), corresponding to $6.53 \pm 1.04$ km/s. This
                    speed is lower than the expected of around $45''$/hr, which could be explained by the comet moving more
                    in the radial direction than predicted and/or by the short observation period, resulting in a higher error.
                    The brightness was measured to a lower value
                    ($16.2$) than presented by the community ($12-15.7$), which most likely is a result of high
                    cloud cover during the observation.</p>
